Ms. Naomi, he is trying to intimidate you into giving up the tavern. Do not fall for it. You have rights. #speaker: L-KRON 385 
I knew I should've had you hauled to the scrapyard after the old fool kicked the spittoon... very well, there is indeed a seven-day waiting period. If you don't come up with the money exactly one week from now, you can kiss your dumpy tavern goodbye! # speaker: Lord Smellingham

    -> END
