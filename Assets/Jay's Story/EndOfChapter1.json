Your father ran this tavern as a talk-easy. ",{"#":"speaker: L-KRON"},"\n","^But... but why?! Why would my father risk his livelihood and his freedom by opening his door to syndicate activity?! ",{"#":"speaker: Naomi"},"\n","^Ever since the Proscription Decree came into effect, providing forbidden vices has become quite lucrative.

But-- ",{"#":"speaker: Naomi"},"\n","^Well then, that's a bit of a problem, you see. That means a crime has been committed here, and Constabulary activity always attracts a ruckus.
