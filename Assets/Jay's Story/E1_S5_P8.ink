Respectfully, Your Lordship, you cannot do that. #speaker: L-KRON 385
Oh! And why should I listen to this pile of rickety scrap metal?! # speaker: Lord Smellingham
City Ordinance No. 973-57, Section 9, also known as the Renter's Protection Ordinance, stipulates that landowners cannot immediately evict tenants for non-payment of rent or levies. There is a seven-day waiting period, during which the tenant may appeal the eviction to the Renter's Board. You already know this, sir. The late Mr. Steele's solicitor has reminded you several times.
