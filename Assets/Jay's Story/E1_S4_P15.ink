I... I don't quite follow, Inspector. # speaker: Naomi
Oh, don't play daft with me, lass. I know your father and his Syndicate friends were running a talk-easy here, in brazen defiance of Regional Decree 493, Section 15, Provision 258. #speaker: Inspector
Wait... what? # speaker: Naomi
Not that I ever saw proof of it, but I'll have you know, after 30 years on the force, I know a dodger when I see one. And your father was, shall I say, a damned bloody dodger! #speaker: Inspector
I... this is the first I'm hearing of this! # speaker: Naomi
Hmph. You expect me to believe that?! Once a dodger, always a dodgerâ€”and the dodger never falls far from its branch! #speaker: Inspector
