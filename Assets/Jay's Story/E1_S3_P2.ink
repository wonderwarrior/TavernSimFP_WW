Oh! Where are my manners? I do beg your pardon, Ms. Steele. I have certain... habits I've formed while dallying with the ladies. I should know to afford my old friend's daughter more respect than that. #speaker: Maxwell
It's... ok, Mr. Fairbeard. # speaker: Naomi
Max. I insist. #speaker: Maxwell
Very well, Max. May I get you anything? # speaker: Naomi
Well, nothing like some Kentucky Fried Salisbury Steak to clear the nightâ€™s overhang, wouldn't you agree? # speaker: Maxwell
Can't say I'd know anything about that. But I'll get your steak to you right away. # speaker: Naomi
'Atta girl! #speaker: Maxwell
