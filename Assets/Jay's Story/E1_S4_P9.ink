Not fond enough... # speaker: Naomi
Naomi, dear, I know how deep it hurts to have never known him. I can sense it emanating from your heart, like a dark mist. But believe me, he had very good reasons to keep you away. #speaker: Elisha

All will become clear, when the fates decide. For now, I'll reveal to you a clue--he's right over there! #speaker: Elisha
